Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)
==========================================

Using Visual Studio
-------------------

The full-version Visual Studio (not just Visual Studio Code) will greatly aid your development of C++ programs, like the final project. (Note that Visual Studio on Mac does not C++ support, so this is just for Windows users.)

You can [Visual Studio Community Edition](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/community/) for free. Knowing how to use Visual Studio is a great job skill!

Here is a 12-minute tutorial on how to use Visual Studio.

Xcode for macOS
---------------

Although there is an macOS version of Visual Studio, it does not support C++ development. There are several other IDEs for C++ development on a Mac, but the default choice is Apple's [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode).
