Letter grades will be calculated from the following ranges.

![Mapping from grade average to letter grade.](/images/syllabus/letter-grades.svg){.light-only}
![Mapping from grade average to letter grade.](/images/syllabus/letter-grades-dark.svg){.dark-only}

### Late Work

Deadlines are an inevitable part of life. Meeting deadlines is an
important part of becoming a professional computer scientist. To further
instill this within each of you, I am making a concerted effort to stick
to all deadlines for programming exercises. *Late work will **not** be
accepted for a grade.*

The lowest assignment problem grade and the lowest quiz grade will be
dropped at the end of the semester. Therefore, if you are a
conscientious student and turn in all homework, you will benefit by
dropping the lowest score. If you miss one deadline, that grade of zero
will be dropped. If you miss multiple deadlines, your grade will be
affected. I will look at your late work and let you know how you did if
you bring it to me; however, *any and all late work will receive a grade
of zero*.

### Teamwork

Teamwork is a highly valued skill in the workplace and society. For team 
projects, the professor will use his/her discretion as
to the team members and will direct each team to produce a single
solution. The goal is to develop an understanding of what makes teams
successful and to be able to be an effective teammate.

## Academic Integrity and the Honor Code

All students must adhere to [Charleston Southern University’s Academic
Integrity
Policy](https://www.charlestonsouthern.edu/wp-content/uploads/Policy-R-58-updated-July-2025.pdf)
and the [Computer Science Departmental
Guidelines](https://csu-cs.github.io/csci-235/integrity). **All
assignments** are individual assignments unless explicitly specified by
the professor. Do not collaborate, search for posted solutions, or post
code online. **You must write every line of your programs.** Do not use
**ANY** outside sources of code. Referencing code written by someone
else (including AI) or sharing your code (online or in-person) violates
the Academic Integrity Policy and will be reported. **Publicly posting
related code is prohibited** (e.g., **don’t** post to forums,
public repositories, chegg.com, etc.). Do NOT look at your neighbor’s
screen for hints or ask, “How did you do that?”, unless you talk to me
**beforehand**.

-   **NEVER** look at someone else’s code in person or online
    (chegg.com, forums, email, etc.).  
    **Do** ask your professor if you have questions or get stuck.
-   **NEVER** search online for assignment solutions.  
    **Do** only reference code given by the instructor or resources in
    the [Course Materials](#course-materials) list.
-   **NEVER** exchange code in any manner or tell someone what code
    they need.  
    **You may** talk to classmates about C++ or assignments without
    sharing ideas for solutions.
-   **NEVER** use an AI tool to generate code for use in an assignment
    or exam without explicit permission from the instructor for that
    particular task. As an example, Visual Studio Code extensions that
    generate code (like GitHub Copile, Tabnine, and Cody) are
    prohibited.

### AI Policy for CSCI 235

**Level 1. Use of generative AI is *prohibited* in this course.**

To ensure development and mastery of the concepts and skills in this
course, the use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools is
prohibited. Students who are unsure of this policy or any
assignment-specific directions, including whether a given technology is
considered AI, should consult the course instructor before using such
technology to complete their assignment.

While proper AI use is an important skill that will be emphasized in
other courses, AI misuse short-circuits the learning process to give the
illusion of proficiency without the necessary depth. It is unethical to
take full credit for work created with the help of AI. This principle is
the same as using someone else’s idea without citing it.

[Review the departmental policies for AI use in Computer Science
coursework.](https://csu-cs.github.io/csci-235/integrity#artificial-intelligence-ai)

### A Community of Honor

>   As a liberal arts university committed to the Christian faith,
>   Charleston Southern University seeks to develop ethical men and women
>   of disciplined, creative minds and lives that focus on leadership,
>   service, and learning. The Honor System of Charleston Southern
>   University is designed to provide an academic community of trust in
>   which students can enjoy the opportunity to grow both intellectually
>   and personally. For these purposes, the following rules and guidelines
>   will be applied.

>   “*Academic Dishonesty*” is the transfer, receipt, or use of academic 
>   information, or the attempted transfer, receipt, or use of academic 
>   information in a manner not authorized by the instructor or by university 
>   rules. It includes, but is not limited to, cheating, plagiarism, and 
>   forgery, as well as aiding or encouraging another to commit academic 
>   dishonesty.

>   “*Cheating*” is defined as wrongfully giving, taking, or presenting any 
>   information or material borrowed from another source (including the 
>   Internet) by a student with the intent of aiding himself or another in 
>   academic work. This includes, but is not limited to, a test, examination, 
>   presentation, experiment, or any written assignment, which is considered in 
>   any way in the determination of the final grade. Using AI in violation of a 
>   course or assessment’s stated AI protocol is cheating.

>   “*Plagiarism*” is the taking or attempted taking of an idea, a writing, a 
>   graphic, a music composition, art, or datum of another person or Artificial 
>   Intelligence (AI) tool without giving proper credit and presenting or 
>   attempting to present it as one's own, with or without intent. It is also 
>   taking written materials of one's own that have been used for a previous 
>   course assignment and using them without reference to them in their original 
>   form. Any use of AI models without proper citation is plagiarism. Students 
>   are encouraged to ask their instructor(s) for clarification regarding their 
>   academic dishonesty standards.

>   Students are encouraged to ask their instructor(s) for clarification 
>   regarding their academic dishonesty standards. Instructors are encouraged to 
>   include academic dishonesty/integrity standards in their course syllabi. 
>   Violations of this policy will result in academic discipline, up to and 
>   including expulsion from the University.

Violations of this policy will result in academic discipline, up to and
including University expulsion.

## Department and University Policies

### LockDown Browser + Webcam Requirement

This course requires the use of LockDown Browser and a webcam for online
quizzes and exams. The webcam can be the type that’s built into your
computer or one that plugs in with a USB cable.

Watch [this brief
video](https://web.respondus.com/lockdownbrowser-student-video/) to get
a basic understanding of LockDown Browser and the webcam feature.

#### Instructions

1.  [Download and install LockDown
    Browser](https://download.respondus.com/lockdown/download.php?id=144243390).
2.  Once installed, start LockDown Browser
3.  Log into Blackboard Learn
4.  Navigate to the test

Note: You won’t be able to access tests with a standard web browser. If
this is tried, an error message will indicate that the test requires the
use of LockDown Browser. Simply start LockDown Browser and navigate back
to the test to continue.

#### Guidelines

When taking an online test, follow these guidelines:

-   Ensure you’re in a location where you won’t be interrupted.
-   Turn off all other devices (e.g., tablets, phones, other computers)
    and place them out of reach.
-   Ensure that you’ve allotted sufficient time to complete the test
    before starting.
-   Clear your workspace of all unpermitted external materials – books,
    papers, other devices
-   Remain at your computer for the duration of the test
-   Run the “Webcam Check” and “System & Network Check” before beginning
    a test on a different computer, Wi-Fi network, or location.
-   To produce a good webcam video, do the following:
    -   Avoid wearing baseball caps or hats with brims
    -   Ensure your computer or device is on a firm surface (a desk or
        table). Do NOT have the computer on your lap, a bed, or other
        surfaces where the device is likely to move.
    -   If using a built-in webcam, avoid readjusting the screen’s tilt
        after the webcam setup.
    -   Have a well-lit room, but avoid backlighting (e.g., having your
        back to a window)
-   Remember that LockDown Browser will prevent you from accessing other
    websites or applications; you will be unable to exit the test until
    all questions are completed and submitted.

#### Getting Help

Several resources are available if you encounter problems with LockDown
Browser:

-   The Windows and Mac versions of LockDown Browser have a “Help
    Center” button located on the toolbar. Use the “System & Network
    Check” to troubleshoot issues. If a test requires you to use a
    webcam, also run the “Webcam Check” from this area
-   You may Chat with [CSU Tech
    Help](https://csuniv.edusupportcenter.com/shp/csuniv/home) 24/7
    about any issues you run into.
-   Respondus has a Knowledge Base available from
    [support.respondus.com](https://support.respondus.com). Select the
    “Knowledge Base” link and then select “Respondus LockDown Browser”
    as the product. If your problem is with a webcam, select “Respondus
    Monitor” as your product
-   If you’re still unable to resolve a technical issue with LockDown
    Browser, go to
    [support.respondus.com](https://support.respondus.com) and select
    “Submit a Ticket”. Provide detailed information about your problem
    and what steps you took to resolve it.

### Weather & Campus Emergencies

In case of adverse weather or other campus emergencies, critical
information will be posted on the CSU homepage and pushed to email
addresses and phone numbers of those people who have updated their
contact information within the BUC Alert System and Blackboard
announcements. If you have not yet updated your contact information, or
set up course notifications within Blackboard, you should do so
immediately.

### Continuity of Instruction

During a pandemic or catastrophic event, and after all face-to-face
instruction has been suspended, communication for our class will
continue to take place through BUC mail and Blackboard. In the event of
such an emergency, check your BUC mail account and Blackboards course
announcements page for instructions. Students are required to use their
BUC mail account to officially communicate with faculty members and
university offices regarding coursework and grades.

### Attendance

Student participation is crucial for academic success. Students are also
expected to check their BUCmail daily and review Blackboard for course
announcements.

There will be a class announcement at the beginning of each week
detailing the week’s work. Stay up to date on these assignments; the
more behind you get the less likely it becomes that you will pass the
course. Email me as soon as you hit a problem; I am more than happy to
help you.

#### On-Ground

Students are expected to attend course meetings and complete
assignments.

Any student who has missed 25% of course meetings will be awarded a
grade of FA (Failure due to Absences). In this course, **FA is awarded
after missing 7 class meetings**. Three (3) instances of tardiness or
leaving class early are equal to one absence. For more information,
please see the [CSU Excessive Absence
Policy](https://www.charlestonsouthern.edu/wp-content/uploads/Policy-R-10-revised-August-2022.pdf).
If you arrive after the roll is called, check in with the professor
directly after class so that you will be recorded as tardy instead of
absent.

#### Online

Participation is crucial in an online course. Students are expected to
access their course(s) daily and complete readings and assessments.
Students are also expected to check their BUCmail daily.

Any student who does not **participate** in this course’s academic
activities for 28 consecutive days will be awarded a grade of FA
(Failure due to Absences). Academic activities include completing
assignments, quizzes, and exams (simply logging in does not count as
attendance). For more information, please see the [CSU’s Excessive
Absences
policy](https://www.charlestonsouthern.edu/wp-content/uploads/Policy-R-10-revised-August-2022.pdf).

### Course Evaluations

To pursue our mission of *Academic Excellence in a Christian
Environment*, we must receive feedback from students. The
student-feedback survey is online and will be available to students in
the second half of the semester. Students are strongly encouraged to
complete the short evaluation survey, which is anonymous. Your professor
will let you know when the survey is available. The survey will be
available through your MyCSU account. We greatly value your opinion!

### Student Representatives

These are students who are designated by letter to represent the
University on official business (e.g., athletic, music, and similar
events). If officially scheduled absences cause these students to miss
tests, assignments, or similar academic activities, university policy
allows these to be made up without penalty. Student Representatives may
opt to either make-up tests *before* departure or supplanting missed
tests with the final exam grade. Final exams must always be taken
*before* departure to avoid an Incomplete for the course. Scheduled
assignments remain subject to the lateness policy and must be turned in
before departure to avoid lateness penalties. Student Representatives
are responsible to inform the instructor of official absences and to
make all appropriate arrangements.

### Internet Etiquette

Charleston Southern University (CSU) holds students, faculty, and staff
to the highest standards of conduct and expects to demonstrate courteous
behaviors and practices in online communications. This policy includes
guidelines and recommendations for online communications. Being
respectful, thoughtful, meaningful, and ethical are fundamental to good
netiquette.

CSU’s basic netiquette rules are:

-   Course communications are for internal use only and considered
    confidential. Do not forward or quote discussion posts, emails, or
    other course communications to outside parties.
-   Never share personal login usernames, IDs, or passwords.
-   Do not type in all capital letters. It is perceived online as
    shouting.
-   Use proper capitalization, grammar, spelling, and punctuation
    conventions for professional communications.
-   Avoid texting jargon or abbreviations without explanation.
    -   Incorrect: “CSU is a wonderful university.”
    -   Correct: “Charleston Southern University (CSU) is a wonderful
        university.”
-   Be mindful of sending emails. Ensure that content is relevant and
    pay attention to *Reply* versus *Reply All*.
-   BucMail is the only email allowed for course communications. Other
    platforms (Yahoo, Gmail, etc.) are prohibited.
-   In video conferencing, mute your microphone when not speaking.
-   Differing views are natural and welcome in discussion boards. Be
    respectful in your comments, even if you disagree or dislike
    someone’s position.
-   Respect the time and availability of students, faculty, and staff.
    Address emails within 24 hours of receipt. Keep in mind that
    traditional faculty work hours are 8 a.m. – 5 p.m. EST.

### Accessibility Services

Any student who may need accommodations should review the
requirements/procedures on the [Accessibility Services
website](https://www.charlestonsouthern.edu/academics/student-success-center/accessibility-services/).
Once approved to receive accommodations, the student must contact the
